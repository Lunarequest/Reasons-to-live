# Reasons to live

This is a project I started in my free time. Someone close to me was at the time dealing with some issues with mental health. I watched a play a while back where the protognist made a list of reasons why his mother(who was dealing with such issues) should live. (for the life of me I can't remmber the name of the play I'll update this when I remmber. 

you can head to <https://reasons-to-live.herokuapp.com/> to see the website and submit a reason you live for. If you want to develop this checkout [the developer guide](develop_localy.md)

Currently we only take SFW(safe for work)/PG-13 reasons. There are no other restrictions other then only SFW and PG-13

I hope this helps you.
